#Summary:
I did not get as far as I would have liked with this challenge, but I learned A TON. After spending time organizing tasks, use cases, and researching some options for the admin needs of this site, I started to dive in and quickly realized my Rails was more rusty than I has thought (pun intended!). My current freelance development work has been more front-end based and has kept me from keeping my RoR skills alive and growing. I spent a good amount of time initially reviewing and toying around with a test app to get re-acquainted with Rails.

I decided to stop where I was and simply share with you my process leading up to the start of my coding this app and what I have coded so far. I plan to continue with this challenge on my own time as it will be a great way to get some more practice in.

With all of that said, this challenge really drove home the personal realization that where I shine most is in planning, researching, and organizing projects like these. I started by taking the challenge description and breaking it down into requirements of the client interface (theater owner) and the requirements of the theater’s tcstomer interface (i.e. - regular user and admin user).
